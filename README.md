# Parse Afstemningskonklusion in Folketinget's Åbne Data (The Danish Parliament's Open Data)

This reposity is not affiliated with The Danish Parliament and the contents of this repository are not endorsed by The Danish Parliament. I wrote the code for a private project and thought that others might find it helpful.
parse_regex.R contains functions to parse the field Afstemningskonklusion in most data from 2010 or later in Folketinget's Åbne Data.
The format of the field Afstemningskonklusion changes in 2010, and the script cannot be used to parse the field Afstemningskonklusion in data from 2009 or earlier.
